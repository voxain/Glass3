* Customizable desktop(*)
* Multiple users
* App Store
* Open App system for third-party apps(*)
* File System with Explorer(*)

# App Ideas

## Terminal(*)
For interfacing with common features of the system.
An idea is to make it a comprehensive scripting language which would also allow for scripts to be written, saved to disk and executed later on with variables etc.

## Web browser(*)
Self-explanatory.

## Text editor(*)
Plain text editor for plain text files.
Idea for this is to make it support Code and/or syntax highlighting, and ideally make it integrated with the planned Shell. Maybe a separate app as an ISE.

## Sticky Notes
Much like Windows Sticky Notes app, it will allow you to pin notes to your desktop or maybe somewhere else.

## Audio Workstation
A simple audio editor or maybe even some resemblence of a DAW.
